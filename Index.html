			<p>Myazaki by-way-of Pintrest, this short is a dazzling journey through a hand-crafted fantasy world that celebrates creativity, ingenuity and drive. An unnamed girl travels down a mist shrouded river towards a fearsome castle that floats in the sky before utilizing fantastic machines of her own creation to scale the castle walls. To defeat a fearsome Harpy Queen that resides there, she must tap into a sublime power that cannot be understood or controlled. Will she survive to tell the tale?</p>

			<h2>Visual Effects</h2>
				<p>This film is an ambitious marriage of traditional and modern film-making. Avoiding digital effects, the filmmakers unite the traditional techniques of paper-craft and diorama making with green-screen technology to set their film in a fantastical universe.</p>

				<p>The sets are large-scale dioramas constructed with accordion-style paper layers, to create depth and fantasy. The actors are shot on green-screen and, during editing, shrunk and added into the diorama, to interact with and move through the paper-craft world. The final effect is a seamless and otherworldly experience, where the imaginary exists.</p>

				<p>As for our otherworldly characters - the satyr and harpy - makeup, props and costumes will bring these individuals to life.</p>

			<h2>About the Filmmakers</h2>
				<p>On any given Wednesday, Andrew and Carol can be found in Andrew's apartment listening to obscure records, googling images of half-human beings and talking loudly.</p> 

				<p>With an admiration for Myazaki, Samurai Jack, Tim Burton, and analogue filmmaking, Andrew and Carol's approach to filmmaking is take a difficult idea, make it impossible, then ask all their friends to do it for free.</p>

				<p>Born with the same brand of weird, their creative projects move forward in spite of their short attention-spans because they are supremely optimistic.</p>

				<p>This is their first film together. </p>

						<h4>Andrew Shenkman</h4>
						<p>Andrew is a Toronto based writer, musician and multi-media artist who works primarily in childrenâ€™s television. Andrew can often be found giving improvised musical performances, talking too loudly about movies and seeking out talented collaborators wherever they may be found. He is easily distracted by movement and/or brightly coloured materials and has recently completed all 7 seasons of The Gilmore Girls.</p>
						<p> Find some of his work and inspirations <a href="http://www.andrewshenkman.com/" target="_blank" Title:"Andrew Shenkman's Tumblr">here</a>.</p>

						<img src="IMG_9656.jpg" alt="Carol Burbank, Filmmaker">
						<h4>Carol Burbank</h4>
						<p>Carol's life is a performance currently in act V, or perhaps at intermission. Disability rights lawyer some of the time, film wardrober other times, and paper crafter all the time, Carol is best described by the facebook test that determined her spirit animal is a chameleon, if that chameleone suffers from crippling anxiety.</p>

						<p>Often found vigorously dancing, lake swimming, bicycling long distances, making soups, gardening, and feeling-up natural fibers, Carol is incredibly proud of her shoe collection and owns a <a href="http://www.pretapreter.ca" target="_blank" title="Pret a Preter">clothing library</a> in Toronto.</p>
